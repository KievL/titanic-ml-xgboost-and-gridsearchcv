# Titanic ML with XGBoost and GridSearchCV

This project focuses on analyzing the famous Titanic dataset available on Kaggle and developing a predictive AI model to classify the survival outcome of passengers.
I use XGBoost as the core algorithm and optimize it using GridSearchCV to improve model performance. The main goals of this project is to study and understand data science and ML fundamentals exploring the dataset, extracting meaningful insights, and developing a model for survival prediction.
